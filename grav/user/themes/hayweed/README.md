### Laravel Mix

Laravel Mix is preconfigured when installing a fresh instance of this theme. However it might be a good idea to review the full documentation [on GitHub.](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/tree/master/docs#readme)

```shell
# Compile assets without minification
$ yarn dev

# Watch working assets
$ yarn watch

# Minify and compile assets for production
$ yarn production
```

> Compiled assets goes into the `dist/` directory, these files are generated for you through Laravel Mix, you should **not** edit these files manually! Your working directory is `resources/`.
